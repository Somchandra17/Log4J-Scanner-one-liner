# Log4J-Scanner-one-liner

This One liner bash script scans the domains and it's subdomains for Log4j (CVE-2021-4428)
with help of "Subfinder", "HTTPX" and "httprobe".

MAKE sure that you have "Subfinder", "HTTPX" and "httprobe" installed.

REPLACE domain.com and BURPC.LINK with your own burp collaborator link.
